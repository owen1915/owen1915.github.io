    <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
    <p>I have my high school diploma from Open High School, which is a highly ranked specialty school in Virginia.
        While studying at Open High School, I dual-enrolled at J Sargent Reynolds Community College and attained my 2-year
        associate's degree. I am currently in my sophomore year at Virginia Tech, pursuing a Bachelor's (and potentially a Master's)
        in Computer Science.</p>

<div class="about-box">
    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>My name is Owen Goodman, and I grew up in Richmond, Virginia. I've always been a competitive person, soccer was my
        game back in the day, but now I channel that energy into everything I do. I come from a hardworking family; my mother
        is a teacher, and my father is an accountant, and they've instilled in me a strong work ethic that's become second nature.

        I genuinely love coding. For me, it's more than just writing lines of code, it's the thrill of solving challenging
        problems and creating something meaningful. It's the reason I can lose myself at my desk for hours, feeling like
        no time has passed at all. I think that's what sets me apart from many of my peers: coding isn't just a skill I'm
        learning, it's something I'm passionate about. I thrive on the challenge, and I'm always hungry for the next problem to solve.</div>
