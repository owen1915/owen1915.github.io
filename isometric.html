        Very early version of the isometric game engine however, in the video above you can find a working chunk rendering
        system and a ray tracing algorithm to detect where to correctly place the blocks based on which side of the
        block you click on.
        <br><br>
        The engine is completely developed in Java and I've been working on this project for about a month now. At first I
        started making a 2d game which is under another project tab called "Lizard King", however one of my best friends
        has been working on an isometric game engine for awhile and I was very intrigued on how it worked. We were going to
        collaborate and make a game together to further enhance our coding skills but life got in the way and he didn't really
        want to rebuild his entire engine again but I needed to understand how it worked. So I created his game engine again
        and this is the result.
        <br><br>
        I learned a lot about developing while making this engine, even though its still very primative. The biggest thing
        I have learned is how optimized some games really are and how important it is to fully optimize your software. When
        you are drawing to the screen 60 times per second, you have to make each draw call take less than 16.67ms. Another tip
        I learned was to whenever developing software, imagine you're developing it for a toaster or a calculator. Otherwise
        you will get caught up in next gen hardware that not everyone can afford.
